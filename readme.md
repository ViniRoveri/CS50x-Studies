# Study Notes Per Week

<br/>

## Week 0

   - Computers use bits to represent data due to it being simple to represent with the transistors and easy to have a lot of data with smaller effort.

   - Computers can represent different type of data with the same bits depending on the context you give it.

   - For characters computer used ASCII that is 7-bit long, then came the Extended ASCII as 8-bit long and lastly unicode that go from 8- to 32-bits.

   - Color can be represented both by Hex or RGB the same way, each red green or blue value is a byte that ranges from 0 to 255.

   - Programming languages are abstractions of the binary the computer understands, so we as developers don't have to worry about how everything is working on a deeper level, and can just write code.

   - Scratch teaches the basic of programming logic with Events, If Statements, Loops, Functions, etc.

## Week 1

   - The C programming language provides it's a very low-level implementation of programming logic concepts using types, variables, loops, functions, etc.

   - Types are important to tell the computer how many bits to alocate to a variable AND for it to undestand the context in which to use the given bits to return the correct data AND to make it so the correct methods can be applied on that variable.

   - When using If Statements it's better to invert the boolean when necessary so you don't ident the main code of the program.

   - Numbers use 64 bits to represent a value, making it simple it's 32 for positive values and 32 for negative values, this ranges from roughly positive to negative 2 billion

   - Integer overflow happens when those 32 bits aren't enough to represent a value.
