Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

Almost all of them, as the rankings at the time did not represent the actual in-field quality of the teams.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

After 100000 simulations, as this is the biggest amount which have the time still under a second.
